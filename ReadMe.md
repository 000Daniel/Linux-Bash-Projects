# Linux Bash Projects Repository

Each folder holds a different project of mine.  
<br />
Some folders might contain multiple versions of a project of mine.   
<br />
Feel free to look around and try some of those programs/scripts for yourself.  
<br />
<br />
<br />
### Note:  
â€‚â€‚â€‚ðŸž„ Support GNU/Linux versions will be noted in the projects themselves.
<br />
â€‚â€‚â€‚ðŸž„ My projects usually are coding exercises, issues are to be expected.  
<br />
â€‚â€‚â€‚ðŸž„ Publish date - refers to the upload date of the project.  
<br />
â€‚â€‚â€‚ðŸž„ Release date - refers to when was the project finished.
